- Docker
- MariaDB

## Project Description

This API provides a structured way to manage data commonly found in a Pokedex, such as Pok√©mon attributes, types, and type relationships. The project structure includes controllers for handling requests and services for processing data.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Windows or Linux
- Java 17
- Docker

1. **Create a Docker Volume:**
    First, create a volume to persist MariaDB data:
    ```bash
    docker volume create my_mariadb_volume
    ```
2. **Run the MariaDB Container:**
    Start a MariaDB container and map the volume:
    ```bash
    docker run --name my_mariadb_container -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -v my_mariadb_volume:/var/lib/mysql -p 3306:3306 -d mariadb:11.4.2
    ```
    `my_mariadb_container`: Name for the MariaDB Docker container.

    `my-secret-pw`: The password for accesing the database. It is recommended to change it.

    `my_mariadb_volume`: Name for the volume where the data is going to be hosted.
  
3. **Access the Container:** 
    To access the MariaDB container, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it my_mariadb_container bash
    ```
    This will open an interactive shell session inside the MariaDB container.

4. **Log into MariaDB:** 
    Once inside the container, log into MariaDB with the following command:
    ```bash
    mariadb -u root -p
    ```
    You will be prompted to enter the password. Use the password set during the container setup (e.g., `my-secret-pw`).

5. **Create the Database:** 
    After successfully logging into MariaDB, create a new database named pokedex by running:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE pokedex;
    ```
    Switch to the newly created database:
    ```sql
    USE pokedex;
    ```

6. **Fill the Database with data:** 
  `pokedex_init.sql` contains the structure of the database and some initial data that is basic for the correct behaviour of the application.
    You can paste all the script in the console to make it work.
    - **[pokedex_init.sql](pokedex_init.sql)**: Initializes the database schema and basic data.
    
    In case you want some additional information, you can do the same with **[pokedex_list.sql](pokedex_list.sql)**, which will add the first 151 Pok√©mon and their stats to the database.

7. **Java Installed:**  
   Ensure you have a compatible version of Java installed (e.g., Java 17).  
   - To check if Java is installed, run the following command in a terminal:  
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
   - If Java is not installed, download and install it from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

8. **Database Configuration:**  
   Update the `application.properties` file with the correct database `url`, `username`, and `password`.

### Running the Application

1. Place the following files in the same directory:
   - `PokeDex-X.X.X-SNAPSHOT.jar` (the application file)
   - `application.properties` (the configuration file)

2. **Edit the `application.properties` file:**  
   Open the file in a text editor and update the following properties based on your database setup:

    `<your-database-host>`: The host of your database server (e.g., localhost for local or an IP/domain for remote servers).

    `<port>`: The port number your database server is listening on (default for MariaDB is `3306`).

    `<your-username>`: The username used to connect to the database (e.g., `root` for default MariaDB setup).

    `<your-password>`: The password associated with the database username for authentication.
    
   ```properties
    server.address=0.0.0.0
    spring.application.name=PokeDex
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://<your-database-host>:<port>/pokedex
    spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
    spring.datasource.password=<your-password>
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MariaDBDialect
    
3. **Run the Application:**
    Double-click the `PokeDex-X.X.X-SNAPSHOT.jar` file to start the application. Alternatively, you can run it from a terminal:
    ```bash
     java -jar PokeDex-X.X.X-SNAPSHOT.jar
     ```

4. Once the application starts, it will be accessible at:
http://localhost:8080 (or the address configured in `application.properties`).
